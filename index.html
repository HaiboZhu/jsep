<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document describes how the W3C WEBRTC RTCPeerConnection interface<a href="#W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617">[W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617]</a> is used to control the setup, management and teardown of a multimedia session.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#sec.general-design-of-jsep" id="sec.general-design-of-jsep">General Design of JSEP</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The thinking behind WebRTC call setup has been to fully specify and control the media plane, but to leave the signaling plane up to the application as much as possible. The rationale is that different applications may prefer to use different protocols, such as the existing SIP or Jingle call signaling protocols, or something custom to the particular application, perhaps for a novel use case. In this approach, the key information that needs to be exchanged is the multimedia session description, which specifies the necessary transport and media configuration information necessary to establish the media plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">With these considerations in mind, this document describes the Javascript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP) that allows for full control of the signaling state machine from Javascript.  JSEP removes the browser almost entirely from the core signaling flow, which is instead handled by the Javascript making use of two interfaces: (1) passing in local and remote session descriptions and (2) interacting with the ICE state machine.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it always occurs between two browsers. Note though in many cases it will actually be between a browser and some kind of server, such as a gateway or MCU. This distinction is invisible to the browser; it just follows the instructions it is given via the API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed, the initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer() API. The application optionally modifies that offer, and then uses it to set up its local config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is then sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling mechanism (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the remote party installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">To complete the offer/answer exchange, the remote party uses the createAnswer() API to generate an appropriate answer, applies it using the setLocalDescription() API, and sends the answer back to the initiator over the signaling channel. When the initiator gets that answer, it installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API, and initial setup is complete. This process can be repeated for additional offer/answer exchanges.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Regarding ICE <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, JSEP decouples the ICE state machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE state machine must remain in the browser, because only the browser has the necessary knowledge of candidates and other transport info.  Performing this separation also provides additional flexibility; in protocols that decouple session descriptions from transport, such as Jingle, the session description can be sent immediately and the transport information can be sent when available. In protocols that don't, such as SIP, the information can be used in the aggregated form. Sending transport information separately can allow for faster ICE and DTLS startup, since ICE checks can start as soon as any transport information is available rather than waiting for all of it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does require the application to be aware of the signaling process. While the application does not need to understand the contents of session descriptions to set up a call, the application must call the right APIs at the right times, convert the session descriptions and ICE information into the defined messages of its chosen signaling protocol, and perform the reverse conversion on the messages it receives from the other side.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.8">One way to mitigate this is to provide a Javascript library that hides this complexity from the developer; said library would implement a given signaling protocol along with its state machine and serialization code, presenting a higher level call-oriented interface to the application developer. For example, libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP or XMPP.  Thus, JSEP provides greater control for the experienced developer without forcing any additional complexity on the novice developer.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> <a href="#sec.other-approaches-consider" id="sec.other-approaches-consider">Other Approaches Considered</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to include a lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing session descriptions to the API, the API would produce and consume messages from this protocol. While providing a more high-level API, this put more control of signaling within the browser, forcing the browser to have to understand and handle concepts like signaling glare. In addition, it prevented the application from driving the state machine to a desired state, as is needed in the page reload case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to decouple the management of the media control objects from session descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control each component directly. This was rejected based on a feeling that requiring exposure of this level of complexity to the application programmer would not be beneficial; it would result in an API where even a simple example would require a significant amount of code to orchestrate all the needed interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that needed to be agreed upon and documented. In addition, these API points could be called in any order, resulting in a more complex set of interactions with the media subsystem than the JSEP approach, which specifies how session descriptions are to be evaluated and applied.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the basic session description-oriented API, but to move the mechanism for generating offers and answers out of the browser. Instead of providing createOffer/createAnswer methods within the browser, this approach would instead expose a getCapabilities API which would provide the application with the information it needed in order to generate its own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work that the application needs to do; it needs to know how to generate session descriptions from capabilities, and especially how to generate the correct answer from an arbitrary offer and the supported capabilities.  While this could certainly be addressed by using a library like the one mentioned above, it basically forces the use of said library even for a simple example. Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this problem, but still allows applications to generate their own offers/answers (to a large extent) if they choose, using the description generated by createOffer as an indication of the browser's capabilities.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state machine, other than the generic need to exchange session descriptions in the fashion described by <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a> (offer/answer) in order for both sides of the session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP provides mechanisms to create offers and answers, as well as to apply them to a session.  However, the browser is totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by which these offers and answers are communicated to the remote side, including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare handling.  These issues are left entirely up to the application; the application has complete control over which offers and answers get handed to the browser, and when.</p>

<h2 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#sec.session-descriptions-and-" id="sec.session-descriptions-and-">Session Descriptions and State Machine</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">In order to establish the media plane, the user agent needs specific parameters to indicate what to transmit to the remote side, as well as how to handle the media that is received. These parameters are determined by the exchange of session descriptions in offers and answers, and there are certain details to this process that must be handled in the JSEP APIs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Whether a session description applies to the local side or the remote side affects the meaning of that description. For example, the list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates what the local side is willing to receive, which, when intersected with the set of codecs the remote side supports, specifies what the remote side should send.  However, not all parameters follow this rule; for example, the DTLS-SRTP parameters <a href="#RFC5763">[RFC5763]</a> sent to a remote party indicate what certificate the local side will use in DTLS setup, and thereby what the remote party should expect to receive; the remote party will have to accept these parameters, with no option to choose different values.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the format of offers versus answers. For example, an offer may propose an arbitrary number of media streams (i.e. m= sections), but an answer must contain the exact same number as the offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Lastly, while the exact media parameters are only known only after an offer and an answer have been exchanged, it is possible for the offerer to receive media after they have sent an offer and before they have received an answer. To properly process incoming media in this case, the offerer's media handler must be aware of the details of the offer before the answer arrives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly, the user agent needs: </p>

<ol>
  <li>To know if a session description pertains to the local or remote side.</li>
  <li>To know if a session description is an offer or an answer.</li>
  <li>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the answer.</li>
</ol>

<p> JSEP addresses this by adding both setLocalDescription and setRemoteDescription methods and having session description objects contain a type field indicating the type of session description being supplied. This satisfies the requirements listed above for both the offerer, who first calls setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), as well as for the answerer, who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.6">JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional by the application. Provisional answers provide a way for an answerer to communicate initial session parameters back to the offerer, in order to allow the session to begin, while allowing a final answer to be specified later. This concept of a final answer is important to the offer/answer model; when such an answer is received, any extra resources allocated by the caller can be released, now that the exact session configuration is known. These "resources" can include things like extra ICE components, TURN candidates, or video decoders.  Provisional answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation results; as a result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers can be received and applied during call setup.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.7">In <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>, the constraint at the signaling level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given session, but at the media stack level, a new offer can be generated at any point. For example, when using SIP for signaling, if one offer is sent, then cancelled using a SIP CANCEL, another offer can be generated even though no answer was received for the first offer. To support this, the JSEP media layer can provide an offer via the createOffer() method whenever the Javascript application needs one for the signaling.  The answerer can send back zero or more provisional answers, and finally end the offer-answer exchange by sending a final answer. The state machine for this is as follows:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">In the WebRTC specification, session descriptions are formatted as SDP messages. While this format is not optimal for manipulation from Javascript, it is widely accepted, and frequently updated with new features. Any alternate encoding of session descriptions would have to keep pace with the changes to SDP, at least until the time that this new encoding eclipsed SDP in popularity. As a result, JSEP currently uses SDP as the internal representation for its session descriptions.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">However, to simplify Javascript processing, and provide for future flexibility, the SDP syntax is encapsulated within a SessionDescription object, which can be constructed from SDP, and be serialized out to SDP. If future specifications agree on a JSON format for session descriptions, we could easily enable this object to generate and consume that JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Other methods may be added to SessionDescription in the future to simplify handling of SessionDescriptions from Javascript. In the meantime, Javascript libraries can be used to perform these manipulations.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.p.2">RtpTransceivers generally have a 1:1 mapping with m= sections, although there may be more RtpTransceivers than m= sections when RtpTransceivers are created but not yet associated with a m= section, or if RtpTransceivers have been stopped and disassociated from m= sections.

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.1">JSEP gathers ICE candidates as needed by the application.  Collection of ICE candidates is referred to as a gathering phase, and this is triggered either by the addition of a new or recycled m= line to the local session description, or new ICE credentials in the description, indicating an ICE restart. Use of new ICE credentials can be triggered explicitly by the application, or implicitly by the browser in response to changes in the ICE configuration.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.2">When the ICE configuration changes in a way that requires a new gathering phase, a 'needs-ice-restart' bit is set. When this bit is set, calls to the createOffer API will generate new ICE credentials.  This bit is cleared by a call to the setLocalDescription API with new ICE credentials from either an offer or an answer, i.e., from either a local- or remote-initiated ICE restart.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.3">When a new gathering phase starts, the ICE Agent will notify the application that gathering is occurring through an event. Then, when each new ICE candidate becomes available, the ICE Agent will supply it to the application via an additional event; these candidates will also automatically be added to the current and/or pending local session description. Finally, when all candidates have been gathered, an event will be dispatched to signal that the gathering process is complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.4">Note that gathering phases only gather the candidates needed by new/recycled/restarting m= lines; other m= lines continue to use their existing candidates.

This process allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately, without having to wait for the caller to gather all possible candidates.  This results in faster media setup in cases where gathering is not performed prior to initiating the call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.2">JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing APIs, as described above, that provide control and feedback on the ICE candidate gathering process.  Applications that support candidate trickling can send the initial offer immediately and send individual candidates when they get the notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support this feature can simply wait for the indication that gathering is complete, and then create and send their offer, with all the candidates, at this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.3">Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving application will supply them to its ICE Agent. This triggers the ICE Agent to start using the new remote candidates for connectivity checks.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.1">As with session descriptions, the syntax of the IceCandidate object provides some abstraction, but can be easily converted to and from the SDP candidate lines.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.2">The candidate lines are the only SDP information that is contained within IceCandidate, as they represent the only information needed that is not present in the initial offer (i.e., for trickle candidates). This information is carried with the same syntax as the "candidate-attribute" field defined for ICE. For example:</p>
<pre>
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host
</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.3">The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate which m= line it should be associated with. The m= line can be identified in one of two ways; either by a m= line index, or a MID.  The m= line index is a zero-based index, with index N referring to the N+1th m= line in the SDP sent by the entity which sent the IceCandidate.  The MID uses the "media stream identification" attribute, as defined in <a href="#RFC5888">[RFC5888]</a>, Section 4, to identify the m= line.  JSEP implementations creating an ICE Candidate object MUST populate both of these fields. Implementations receiving an ICE Candidate object MUST use the MID if present, or the m= line index, if not (as it could have come from a non-JSEP endpoint).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.1">Typically, when gathering ICE candidates, the browser will gather all possible forms of initial candidates - host, server reflexive, and relay. However, in certain cases, applications may want to have more specific control over the gathering process, due to privacy or related concerns. For example, one may want to suppress the use of host candidates, to avoid exposing information about the local network, or go as far as only using relay candidates, to leak as little location information as possible (note that these choices come with corresponding operational costs). To accomplish this, the browser MUST allow the application to restrict which ICE candidates are used in a session. Note that this filtering is applied on top of any restrictions the browser chooses to enforce regarding which IP addresses are permitted for the application, as discussed in <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.2">There may also be cases where the application wants to change which types of candidates are used while the session is active. A prime example is where a callee may initially want to use only relay candidates, to avoid leaking location information to an arbitrary caller, but then change to use all candidates (for lower operational cost) once the user has indicated they want to take the call. For this scenario, the browser MUST allow the candidate policy to be changed in mid-session, subject to the aforementioned interactions with local policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.3">To administer the ICE candidate policy, the browser will determine the current setting at the start of each gathering phase.  Then, during the gathering phase, the browser MUST NOT expose candidates disallowed by the current policy to the application, use them as the source of connectivity checks, or indirectly expose them via other fields, such as the raddr/rport attributes for other ICE candidates.  Later, if a different policy is specified by the application, the application can apply it by kicking off a new gathering phase via an ICE restart.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.5.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5.4">3.5.4.</a> <a href="#sec.ice-candidate-pool" id="sec.ice-candidate-pool">ICE Candidate Pool</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.1">JSEP applications typically inform the browser to begin ICE gathering via the information supplied to setLocalDescription, as this is where the app specifies the number of media streams, and thereby ICE components, for which to gather candidates. However, to accelerate cases where the application knows the number of ICE components to use ahead of time, it may ask the browser to gather a pool of potential ICE candidates to help ensure rapid media setup.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.2">When setLocalDescription is eventually called, and the browser goes to gather the needed ICE candidates, it SHOULD start by checking if any candidates are available in the pool.  If there are candidates in the pool, they SHOULD be handed to the application immediately via the ICE candidate event.  If the pool becomes depleted, either because a larger-than-expected number of ICE components is used, or because the pool has not had enough time to gather candidates, the remaining candidates are gathered as usual.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.3">One example of where this concept is useful is an application that expects an incoming call at some point in the future, and wants to minimize the time it takes to establish connectivity, to avoid clipping of initial media. By pre-gathering candidates into the pool, it can exchange and start sending connectivity checks from these candidates almost immediately upon receipt of a call. Note though that by holding on to these pre-gathered candidates, which will be kept alive as long as they may be needed, the application will consume resources on the STUN/TURN servers it is using.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">Video size negotiation is the process through which a receiver can use the "a=imageattr" SDP attribute <a href="#RFC6236">[RFC6236]</a> to indicate what video frame sizes it is capable of receiving. A receiver may have hard limits on what its video decoder can process, or it may wish to constrain what it receives due to application preferences, e.g. a specific size for the window in which the video will be displayed.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6.1">3.6.1.</a> Creating an imageattr Attribute</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.1">In order to determine the limits on what video resolution a receiver wants to receive, it will intersect its decoder hard limits with any mandatory constraints that have been applied to the associated MediaStreamTrack. If the decoder limits are unknown, e.g. when using a software decoder, the mandatory constraints are used directly. For the answerer, these mandatory constraints can be applied to the remote MediaStreamTracks that are created by a setRemoteDescription call, and will affect the output of the ensuing createAnswer call. Any constraints set after setLocalDescription is used to set the answer will result in a new offer-answer exchange. For the offerer, because it does not know about any remote MediaStreamTracks until it receives the answer, the offer can only reflect decoder hard limits.  If the offerer wishes to set mandatory constraints on video resolution, it must do so after receiving the answer, and the result will be a new offer-answer to communicate them.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.2">If there are no known decoder limits or mandatory constraints, the "a=imageattr" attribute SHOULD be omitted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.3">Otherwise, an "a=imageattr" attribute is created with "recv" direction, and the resulting resolution space formed by intersecting the decoder limits and constraints is used to specify its minimum and maximum x= and y= values. If the intersection is the null set, i.e., there are no resolutions that are permitted by both the decoder and the mandatory constraints, this SHOULD be represented by x=0 and y=0 values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.4">The rules here express a single set of preferences, and therefore, the "a=imageattr" q= value is not important. It SHOULD be set to 1.0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.5">The "a=imageattr" field is payload type specific.  When all video codecs supported have the same capabilities, use of a single attribute, with the wildcard payload type (*), is RECOMMENDED.  However, when the supported video codecs have differing capabilities, specific "a=imageattr" attributes MUST be inserted for each payload type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.6">As an example, consider a system with a HD-capable, multiformat video decoder, where the application has constrained the received track to at most 360p. In this case, the implementation would generate this attribute:</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.7">a=imageattr:* recv [x=[16:640],y=[16:360],q=1.0]</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.8">This declaration indicates that the receiver is capable of decoding any image resolution from 16x16 up to 640x360 pixels.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.6.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6.2">3.6.2.</a> Interpreting an imageattr Attribute</h3>
<p><a href="#RFC6236">[RFC6236]</a> defines "a=imageattr" to be an advisory field. This means that it does not absolutely constrain the video formats that the sender can use, but gives an indication of the preferred values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.2">This specification prescribes more specific behavior.  When a sender of a given MediaStreamTrack, which is producing video of a certain resolution, receives an "a=imageattr recv" attribute, it MUST check to see if the original resolution meets the size criteria specified in the attribute, and adapt the resolution accordingly by scaling (if appropriate).  Note that when considering a MediaStreamTrack that is producing rotated video, the unrotated resolution MUST be used.  This is required regardless of whether the receiver supports performing receive-side rotation (e.g., through CVO), as it significantly simplifies the matching logic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.3">For an "a=imageattr recv" attribute, only size limits are considered. Any other values, e.g. aspect ratio, MUST be ignored.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.4">When communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint, multiple relevant "a=imageattr recv" attributes may be received. If this occurs, attributes other than the one with the highest "q=" value MUST be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.5">If an "a=imageattr recv" attribute references a different video codec than what has been selected for the MediaStreamTrack, it MUST be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.6">If the original resolution matches the size limits in the attribute, the track MUST be transmitted untouched.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.7">If the original resolution exceeds the size limits in the attribute, the sender SHOULD apply downscaling to the output of the MediaStreamTrack in order to satisfy the limits.  Downscaling MUST NOT change the track aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.8">If the original resolution is less than the size limits in the attribute, upscaling is needed, but this may not be appropriate in all cases. To address this concern, the application can set an upscaling policy for each sent track.  For this case, if upscaling is permitted by policy, the sender SHOULD apply upscaling in order to provide the desired resolution.  Otherwise, the sender MUST NOT apply upscaling.  The sender SHOULD NOT upscale in other cases, even if the policy permits it.  Upscaling MUST NOT change the track aspect ratio.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.9">If there is no appropriate and permitted scaling mechanism that allows the received size limits to be satisfied, the sender MUST NOT transmit the track.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1">Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking where an SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For example, SIP <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> defines both a "Parallel Search" and "Sequential Search". Although these are primarily signaling level issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have some impact on the configuration of the media plane that is relevant. When forking happens at the signaling layer, the Javascript application responsible for the signaling needs to make the decisions about what media should be sent or received at any point of time, as well as which remote endpoint it should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the media engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the application. The basic operations that the applications can have the media engine do are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, but keep all the resources reserved in the offer.</li>
  <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free any resources in the offer that are not being used.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.7.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.7.1">3.7.1.</a> <a href="#sec.sequential-forking" id="sec.sequential-forking">Sequential Forking</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.1.p.1">Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, but only one active session ever exists at a time; no mixing of received media is performed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.1.p.2">JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the application to easily control the policy for selecting the desired remote endpoint.  When an answer arrives from one of the callees, the application can choose to apply it either as a provisional answer, leaving open the possibility of using a different answer in the future, or apply it as a final answer, ending the setup flow.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.1.p.3">In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be applied as a final answer, and the application will reject any subsequent answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK + BYE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.1.p.4">In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be applied as provisional answers, and any previous call leg will be terminated.  At some point, the application will end the setup process, perhaps with a timer; at this point, the application could reapply the pending remote description as a final answer.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.7.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.7.2">3.7.2.</a> <a href="#sec.parallel-forking" id="sec.parallel-forking">Parallel Forking</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.2.p.1">Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, and multiple simultaneous active signaling sessions can be established as a result. If multiple callees send media at the same time, the possibilities for handling this are described in Section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>. Most SIP devices today only support exchanging media with a single device at a time, and do not try to mix multiple early media audio sources, as that could result in a confusing situation. For example, consider having a European ringback tone mixed together with the North American ringback tone - the resulting sound would not be like either tone, and would confuse the user. If the signaling application wishes to only exchange media with one of the remote endpoints at a time, then from a media engine point of view, this is exactly like the sequential forking case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.2.p.2">In the parallel forking case where the Javascript application wishes to simultaneously exchange media with multiple peers, the flow is slightly more complex, but the Javascript application can follow the strategy that <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a> describes using UPDATE. The UPDATE approach allows the signaling to set up a separate media flow for each peer that it wishes to exchange media with. In JSEP, this offer used in the UPDATE would be formed by simply creating a new PeerConnection and making sure that the same local media streams have been added into this new PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would produce a SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to perform the UPDATE strategy discussed in <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.2.p.3">As a result of sharing the media streams, the application will end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each with a local and remote description and their own local and remote addresses. The media flow from these sessions can be managed by specifying SDP direction attributes in the descriptions, or the application can choose to play out the media from all sessions mixed together. Of course, if the application wants to only keep a single session, it can simply terminate the sessions that it no longer needs.</p>

While it is good practice to send an immediate response to an "offer", in order to warm up the session transport and prevent media clipping, the preferred handling for a web application would be to create and send an "inactive" final answer immediately after receiving the offer. Later, when the called user actually accepts the call, the application can create a new "sendrecv" offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start the media flow. While this could also be done with an inactive "pranswer", followed by a sendrecv "answer", the initial "pranswer" leaves the offer-answer exchange open, which means that neither side can send an updated offer during this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1.p.2">As an example, consider a typical web application that will set up a data channel, an audio channel, and a video channel. When an endpoint receives an offer with these channels, it could send an answer accepting the data channel for two-way data, and accepting the audio and video tracks as inactive or receive-only. It could then ask the user to accept the call, acquire the local media streams, and send a new offer to the remote side moving the audio and video to be two-way media. By the time the human has accepted the call and triggered the new offer, it is likely that the ICE and DTLS handshaking for all the channels will already have finished.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.1.p.3">Of course, some applications may not be able to perform this double offer-answer exchange, particularly ones that are attempting to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In these cases, "pranswer" can still provide the application with a mechanism to warm up the transport.</p>
<h4 id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.4.2">4.1.4.2.</a> <a href="#sec.rollback" id="sec.rollback">Rollback</a></h4>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.1">In certain situations it may be desirable to "undo" a change made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription. Consider a case where a call is ongoing, and one side wants to change some of the session parameters; that side generates an updated offer and then calls setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either before or after setRemoteDescription, decides it does not want to accept the new parameters, and sends a reject message back to the offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly the answerer as well, need to return to a stable state and the previous local/remote description. To support this, we introduce the concept of "rollback".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.2">A rollback discards any proposed changes to the session, returning the state machine to the stable state, and setting the pending local and/or remote description back to null.  Any resources or candidates that were allocated by the abandoned local description are discarded; any media that is received will be processed according to the previous local and remote descriptions. Rollback can only be used to cancel proposed changes; there is no support for rolling back from a stable state to a previous stable state. Note that this implies that once the answerer has performed setLocalDescription with his answer, this cannot be rolled back.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.3">A rollback will disassociate any RtpTransceivers that were associated with m= sections by the application of the rolled-back session description (see <a href="#sec.applying-a-remote-desc">Section 5.8</a> and <a href="#sec.applying-a-local-desc">Section 5.7</a>). This means that some RtpTransceivers that were previously associated will no longer be associated with any m= section; in such cases, the value of the RtpTransceiver's mid attribute MUST be set to null. RtpTransceivers that were created by applying a remote offer that was subsequently rolled back MUST be removed.  However, a RtpTransceiver MUST NOT be removed if the RtpTransceiver's RtpSender was activated by the addTrack method. This is so that an application may call addTrack, then call setRemoteDescription with an offer, then roll back that offer, then call createOffer and have a m= section for the added track appear in the generated offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.4.2.p.4">A rollback is performed by supplying a session description of type "rollback" with empty contents to either setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription, depending on which was most recently used (i.e. if the new offer was supplied to setLocalDescription, the rollback should be done using setLocalDescription as well).  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.4.1.5"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.5">4.1.5.</a> <a href="#sec.setlocaldescription" id="sec.setlocaldescription">setLocalDescription</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.1">The setLocalDescription method instructs the PeerConnection to apply the supplied session description as its local configuration. The type field indicates whether the description should be processed as an offer, provisional answer, or final answer; offers and answers are checked differently, using the various rules that exist for each SDP line.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.2">This API changes the local media state; among other things, it sets up local resources for receiving and decoding media. In order to successfully handle scenarios where the application wants to offer to change from one media format to a different, incompatible format, the PeerConnection must be able to simultaneously support use of both the current and pending local descriptions (e.g. support codecs that exist in both descriptions) until a final answer is received, at which point the PeerConnection can fully adopt the pending local description, or roll back to the current description if the remote side denied the change.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.5.p.3">This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering process.  When a local description is supplied, and the number of transports currently in use does not match the number of transports needed by the local description, the PeerConnection will create transports as needed and begin gathering candidates for them.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.11">The application can also modify the SDP to reduce the capabilities in the offer it sends to the far side or the offer that it installs from the far side in any way the application sees fit, as long as it is a valid SDP offer and specifies a subset of what was in the original offer.  This is safe because the answer is not permitted to expand capabilities and therefore will just respond to what is actually in the offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.6.p.12">As always, the application is solely responsible for what it sends to the other party, and all incoming SDP will be processed by the browser to the extent of its capabilities. It is an error to assume that all SDP is well-formed; however, one should be able to assume that any implementation of this specification will be able to process, as a remote offer or answer, unmodified SDP coming from any other implementation of this specification.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">This section shows a very simple example that sets up a minimal audio / video call between two browsers and does not use trickle ICE. The example in the following section provides a more realistic example of what would happen in a normal browser to browser connection. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">The flow shows Alice's browser initiating the session to Bob's browser. The messages from Alice's JS to Bob's JS are assumed to flow over some signaling protocol via a web server. The JS on both Alice's side and Bob's side waits for all candidates before sending the offer or answer, so the offers and answers are complete. Trickle ICE is not used.

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">This section shows a typical example of a session between two browsers setting up an audio channel and a data channel. Trickle ICE is used in full trickle mode with a bundle policy of max-bundle, an RTCP mux policy of require, and a single TURN server.

<h1 id="rfc.section.8"><a href="#rfc.section.8">8.</a> <a href="#sec.security-considerations" id="sec.security-considerations">Security Considerations</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">The IETF has published separate documents <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch]</a> <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]</a> describing the security architecture for WebRTC as a whole.  The remainder of this section describes security considerations for this document.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">While formally the JSEP interface is an API, it is better to think of it is an Internet protocol, with the JS being untrustworthy from the perspective of the browser. Thus, the threat model of <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a> applies.  In particular, JS can call the API in any order and with any inputs, including malicious ones. This is particularly relevant when we consider the SDP which is passed to setLocalDescription(). While correct API usage requires that the application pass in SDP which was derived from createOffer() or createAnswer() (perhaps suitably modified as described in <a href="#sec.configurable-sdp-paramete">Section 6</a>, there is no guarantee that applications do so. The browser MUST be prepared for the JS to pass in bogus data instead.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">Conversely, the application programmer MUST recognize that the JS does not have complete control of browser behavior. One case that bears particular mention is that editing ICE candidates out of the SDP or suppressing trickled candidates does not have the expected behavior: implementations will still perform checks from those candidates even if they are not sent to the other side.  Thus, for instance, it is not possible to prevent the remote peer from learning your public IP address by removing server reflexive candidates. Applications which wish to conceal their public IP address should instead configure the ICE agent to use only relay candidates.  </p>
