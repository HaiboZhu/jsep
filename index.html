  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> <a href="#sec.introduction" id="sec.introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document describes how the W3C WEBRTC RTCPeerConnection interface <a href="#W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617">[W3C.WD-webrtc-20140617]</a> is used to control the setup, management and teardown of a multimedia session.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> <a href="#sec.general-design-of-jsep" id="sec.general-design-of-jsep">General Design of JSEP</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The thinking behind WebRTC call setup has been to fully specify and control the media plane, but to leave the signaling plane up to the application as much as possible. The rationale is that different applications may prefer to use different protocols, such as the existing SIP or Jingle call signaling protocols, or something custom to the particular application, perhaps for a novel use case. In this approach, the key information that needs to be exchanged is the multimedia session description, which specifies the necessary transport and media configuration information necessary to establish the media plane.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.2">With these considerations in mind, this document describes the Javascript Session Establishment Protocol (JSEP) that allows for full control of the signaling state machine from Javascript. As described above, JSEP assumes a model in which a Javascript application executes inside a runtime containing WebRTC APIs (the "JSEP implementation"). The JSEP implementation is almost entirely divorced from the core signaling flow, which is instead handled by the Javascript making use of two interfaces: (1) passing in local and remote session descriptions and (2) interacting with the ICE state machine. The combination of the JSEP implementation and the Javascript application is referred to throughout this document as a "JSEP endpoint". </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.3">In this document, the use of JSEP is described as if it always occurs between two JSEP endpoints. Note though in many cases it will actually be between a JSEP endpoint and some kind of server, such as a gateway or MCU. This distinction is invisible to the JSEP endpoint; it just follows the instructions it is given via the API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.4">JSEP's handling of session descriptions is simple and straightforward. Whenever an offer/answer exchange is needed, the initiating side creates an offer by calling a createOffer() API. The application then uses that offer to set up its local config via the setLocalDescription() API. The offer is finally sent off to the remote side over its preferred signaling mechanism (e.g., WebSockets); upon receipt of that offer, the remote party installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.5">To complete the offer/answer exchange, the remote party uses the createAnswer() API to generate an appropriate answer, applies it using the setLocalDescription() API, and sends the answer back to the initiator over the signaling channel. When the initiator gets that answer, it installs it using the setRemoteDescription() API, and initial setup is complete. This process can be repeated for additional offer/answer exchanges.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.6">Regarding ICE <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, JSEP decouples the ICE state machine from the overall signaling state machine, as the ICE state machine must remain in the JSEP implementation, because only the implementation has the necessary knowledge of candidates and other transport info. Performing this separation also provides additional flexibility; in protocols that decouple session descriptions from transport, such as Jingle, the session description can be sent immediately and the transport information can be sent when available. In protocols that don't, such as SIP, the information can be used in the aggregated form. Sending transport information separately can allow for faster ICE and DTLS startup, since ICE checks can start as soon as any transport information is available rather than waiting for all of it.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.7">Through its abstraction of signaling, the JSEP approach does require the application to be aware of the signaling process.  While the application does not need to understand the contents of session descriptions to set up a call, the application must call the right APIs at the right times, convert the session descriptions and ICE information into the defined messages of its chosen signaling protocol, and perform the reverse conversion on the messages it receives from the other side.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.8">One way to mitigate this is to provide a Javascript library that hides this complexity from the developer; said library would implement a given signaling protocol along with its state machine and serialization code, presenting a higher level call-oriented interface to the application developer. For example, libraries exist to adapt the JSEP API into an API suitable for a SIP or XMPP. Thus, JSEP provides greater control for the experienced developer without forcing any additional complexity on the novice developer.</p>
<h2 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> <a href="#sec.other-approaches-consider" id="sec.other-approaches-consider">Other Approaches Considered</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">One approach that was considered instead of JSEP was to include a lightweight signaling protocol. Instead of providing session descriptions to the API, the API would produce and consume messages from this protocol. While providing a more high-level API, this put more control of signaling within the JSEP implementation, forcing it to have to understand and handle concepts like signaling glare. In addition, it prevented the application from driving the state machine to a desired state, as is needed in the page reload case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">A second approach that was considered but not chosen was to decouple the management of the media control objects from session descriptions, instead offering APIs that would control each component directly. This was rejected based on a feeling that requiring exposure of this level of complexity to the application programmer would not be beneficial; it would result in an API where even a simple example would require a significant amount of code to orchestrate all the needed interactions, as well as creating a large API surface that needed to be agreed upon and documented. In addition, these API points could be called in any order, resulting in a more complex set of interactions with the media subsystem than the JSEP approach, which specifies how session descriptions are to be evaluated and applied.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">One variation on JSEP that was considered was to keep the basic session description-oriented API, but to move the mechanism for generating offers and answers out of the JSEP implementation.  Instead of providing createOffer/createAnswer methods within the implementation, this approach would instead expose a getCapabilities API which would provide the application with the information it needed in order to generate its own session descriptions. This increases the amount of work that the application needs to do; it needs to know how to generate session descriptions from capabilities, and especially how to generate the correct answer from an arbitrary offer and the supported capabilities. While this could certainly be addressed by using a library like the one mentioned above, it basically forces the use of said library even for a simple example.  Providing createOffer/createAnswer avoids this problem.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">JSEP does not specify a particular signaling model or state machine, other than the generic need to exchange session descriptions in the fashion described by <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>(offer/answer) in order for both sides of the session to know how to conduct the session. JSEP provides mechanisms to create offers and answers, as well as to apply them to a session. However, the JSEP implementation is totally decoupled from the actual mechanism by which these offers and answers are communicated to the remote side, including addressing, retransmission, forking, and glare handling. These issues are left entirely up to the application; the application has complete control over which offers and answers get handed to the implementation, and when.</p>

<h2 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#sec.session-descriptions-and-" id="sec.session-descriptions-and-">Session Descriptions and State Machine</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">In order to establish the media plane, the user agent needs specific parameters to indicate what to transmit to the remote side, as well as how to handle the media that is received.  These parameters are determined by the exchange of session descriptions in offers and answers, and there are certain details to this process that must be handled in the JSEP APIs.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">Whether a session description applies to the local side or the remote side affects the meaning of that description. For example, the list of codecs sent to a remote party indicates what the local side is willing to receive, which, when intersected with the set of codecs the remote side supports, specifies what the remote side should send. However, not all parameters follow this rule; for example, the fingerprints <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-4572-update">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-4572-update]</a> sent to a remote party are calculated based on the local certificate(s) offered; the remote party MUST either accept these parameters or reject them altogether, with no option to choose different values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.3">In addition, various RFCs put different conditions on the format of offers versus answers. For example, an offer may propose an arbitrary number of m= sections (i.e., media descriptions as described in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.14), but an answer must contain the exact same number as the offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.4">Lastly, while the exact media parameters are only known only after an offer and an answer have been exchanged, it is possible for the offerer to receive media after they have sent an offer and before they have received an answer. To properly process incoming media in this case, the offerer's media handler must be aware of the details of the offer before the answer arrives.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.5">Therefore, in order to handle session descriptions properly, the user agent needs: </p>

<ol>
  <li>To know if a session description pertains to the local or remote side.</li>
  <li>To know if a session description is an offer or an answer.</li>
  <li>To allow the offer to be specified independently of the answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>JSEP addresses this by adding both setLocalDescription and setRemoteDescription methods and having session description objects contain a type field indicating the type of session description being supplied. This satisfies the requirements listed above for both the offerer, who first calls setLocalDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setRemoteDescription(sdp [answer]), as well as for the answerer, who first calls setRemoteDescription(sdp [offer]) and then later setLocalDescription(sdp [answer]).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.6">JSEP also allows for an answer to be treated as provisional by the application. Provisional answers provide a way for an answerer to communicate initial session parameters back to the offerer, in order to allow the session to begin, while allowing a final answer to be specified later. This concept of a final answer is important to the offer/answer model; when such an answer is received, any extra resources allocated by the caller can be released, now that the exact session configuration is known. These "resources" can include things like extra ICE components, TURN candidates, or video decoders. Provisional answers, on the other hand, do no such deallocation; as a result, multiple dissimilar provisional answers, with their own codec choices, transport parameters, etc., can be received and applied during call setup. Note that the final answer itself may be different than any received provisional answers.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.7">In <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>, the constraint at the signaling level is that only one offer can be outstanding for a given session, but at the media stack level, a new offer can be generated at any point. For example, when using SIP for signaling, if one offer is sent, then cancelled using a SIP CANCEL, another offer can be generated even though no answer was received for the first offer. To support this, the JSEP media layer can provide an offer via the createOffer() method whenever the Javascript application needs one for the signaling. The answerer can send back zero or more provisional answers, and finally end the offer-answer exchange by sending a final answer. The state machine for this is as follows:</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">JSEP's session descriptions use SDP syntax for their internal representation. While this format is not optimal for manipulation from Javascript, it is widely accepted, and frequently updated with new features; any alternate encoding of session descriptions would have to keep pace with the changes to SDP, at least until the time that this new encoding eclipsed SDP in popularity.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">However, to simplify Javascript processing, and provide for future flexibility, the SDP syntax is encapsulated within a SessionDescription object, which can be constructed from SDP, and be serialized out to SDP. If future specifications agree on a JSON format for session descriptions, we could easily enable this object to generate and consume that JSON.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">Other methods may be added to SessionDescription in the future to simplify handling of SessionDescriptions from Javascript. In the meantime, Javascript libraries can be used to perform these manipulations.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.4.1.p.2">RtpTransceivers generally have a 1:1 mapping with m= sections, although there may be more RtpTransceivers than m= sections when RtpTransceivers are created but not yet associated with a m= section, or if RtpTransceivers have been stopped and disassociated from m= sections. An RtpTransceiver is said to be associated with an m= section if its mid property is non-null; otherwise it is said to be disassociated.  The associated m= section is determined using a mapping between transceivers and m= section indices, formed when creating an offer or applying a remote offer. An RtpTransceiver is never associated with more than one m= section, and once a session description is applied, a m= section is always associated with exactly one RtpTransceiver.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.1">JSEP gathers ICE candidates as needed by the application.  Collection of ICE candidates is referred to as a gathering phase, and this is triggered either by the addition of a new or recycled m= section to the local session description, or new ICE credentials in the description, indicating an ICE restart. Use of new ICE credentials can be triggered explicitly by the application, or implicitly by the JSEP implementation in response to changes in the ICE configuration.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.2">When the ICE configuration changes in a way that requires a new gathering phase, a 'needs-ice-restart' bit is set. When this bit is set, calls to the createOffer API will generate new ICE credentials. This bit is cleared by a call to the setLocalDescription API with new ICE credentials from either an offer or an answer, i.e., from either a local- or remote-initiated ICE restart.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.3">When a new gathering phase starts, the ICE agent will notify the application that gathering is occurring through an event. Then, when each new ICE candidate becomes available, the ICE agent will supply it to the application via an additional event; these candidates will also automatically be added to the current and/or pending local session description. Finally, when all candidates have been gathered, an event will be dispatched to signal that the gathering process is complete.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.1.p.4">Note that gathering phases only gather the candidates needed by new/recycled/restarting m= sections; other m= sections continue to use their existing candidates. Also, when bundling is active, candidates are only gathered (and exchanged) for the m= sections referenced in BUNDLE-tags, as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.1">Candidate trickling is a technique through which a caller may incrementally provide candidates to the callee after the initial offer has been dispatched; the semantics of "Trickle ICE" are defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ice-trickle">[I-D.ietf-ice-trickle]</a>. This process allows the callee to begin acting upon the call and setting up the ICE (and perhaps DTLS) connections immediately, without having to wait for the caller to gather all possible candidates. This results in faster media setup in cases where gathering is not performed prior to initiating the call.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.2">JSEP supports optional candidate trickling by providing APIs, as described above, that provide control and feedback on the ICE candidate gathering process. Applications that support candidate trickling can send the initial offer immediately and send individual candidates when they get the notified of a new candidate; applications that do not support this feature can simply wait for the indication that gathering is complete, and then create and send their offer, with all the candidates, at this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.p.3">Upon receipt of trickled candidates, the receiving application will supply them to its ICE agent. This triggers the ICE agent to start using the new remote candidates for connectivity checks.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.1">In JSEP, ICE candidates are abstracted by an IceCandidate object, and as with session descriptions, SDP syntax is used for the internal representation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.2">The candidate details are specified in an IceCandidate field, using the same SDP syntax as the "candidate-attribute" field defined in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, Section 15.1. For example:</p>
<pre>
                
candidate:1 1 UDP 1694498815 192.0.2.33 10000 typ host

</pre>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.3">The IceCandidate object contains a field to indicate which ICE ufrag it is associated with, as defined in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, Section 15.4. This value is used to determine which session description (and thereby which gathering phase) this IceCandidate belongs to, which helps resolve ambiguities during ICE restarts. If this field is absent in a received IceCandidate (perhaps when communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint), the most recently received session description is assumed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.4">The IceCandidate object also contains fields to indicate which m= section it is associated with, which can be identified in one of two ways, either by a m= section index, or a MID. The m= section index is a zero-based index, with index N referring to the N+1th m= section in the session description referenced by this IceCandidate. The MID is a "media stream identification" value, as defined in <a href="#RFC5888">[RFC5888]</a>, Section 4, which provides a more robust way to identify the m= section in the session description, using the MID of the associated RtpTransceiver object (which may have been locally generated by the answerer when interacting with a non-JSEP endpoint that does not support the MID attribute, as discussed in <a href="#sec.applying-a-remote-desc">Section 5.9</a> below).  If the MID field is present in a received IceCandidate, it MUST be used for identification; otherwise, the m= section index is used instead.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.2.1.p.5">When creating an IceCandidate object, JSEP implementations MUST populate all of these fields.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.5.3"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5.3">3.5.3.</a> <a href="#sec.ice-candidate-policy" id="sec.ice-candidate-policy">ICE Candidate Policy</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.1">Typically, when gathering ICE candidates, the JSEP implementation will gather all possible forms of initial candidates - host, server reflexive, and relay. However, in certain cases, applications may want to have more specific control over the gathering process, due to privacy or related concerns. For example, one may want to only use relay candidates, to leak as little location information as possible (keeping in mind that this choice comes with corresponding operational costs). To accomplish this, JSEP allows the application to restrict which ICE candidates are used in a session. Note that this filtering is applied on top of any restrictions the implementation chooses to enforce regarding which IP addresses are permitted for the application, as discussed in <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-ip-handling]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.2">There may also be cases where the application wants to change which types of candidates are used while the session is active. A prime example is where a callee may initially want to use only relay candidates, to avoid leaking location information to an arbitrary caller, but then change to use all candidates (for lower operational cost) once the user has indicated they want to take the call. For this scenario, the JSEP implementation MUST allow the candidate policy to be changed in mid-session, subject to the aforementioned interactions with local policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.3.p.3">To administer the ICE candidate policy, the JSEP implementation will determine the current setting at the start of each gathering phase. Then, during the gathering phase, the implementation MUST NOT expose candidates disallowed by the current policy to the application, use them as the source of connectivity checks, or indirectly expose them via other fields, such as the raddr/rport attributes for other ICE candidates. Later, if a different policy is specified by the application, the application can apply it by kicking off a new gathering phase via an ICE restart.</p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.5.4"><a href="#rfc.section.3.5.4">3.5.4.</a> <a href="#sec.ice-candidate-pool" id="sec.ice-candidate-pool">ICE Candidate Pool</a></h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.1">JSEP applications typically inform the JSEP implementation to begin ICE gathering via the information supplied to setLocalDescription, as this is where the app specifies the number of media streams, and thereby ICE components, for which to gather candidates. However, to accelerate cases where the application knows the number of ICE components to use ahead of time, it may ask the implementation to gather a pool of potential ICE candidates to help ensure rapid media setup.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.2">When setLocalDescription is eventually called, and the JSEP implementation goes to gather the needed ICE candidates, it SHOULD start by checking if any candidates are available in the pool. If there are candidates in the pool, they SHOULD be handed to the application immediately via the ICE candidate event. If the pool becomes depleted, either because a larger-than-expected number of ICE components is used, or because the pool has not had enough time to gather candidates, the remaining candidates are gathered as usual. This only occurs for the first offer/answer exchange, after which the candidate pool is emptied and no longer used.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.5.4.p.3">One example of where this concept is useful is an application that expects an incoming call at some point in the future, and wants to minimize the time it takes to establish connectivity, to avoid clipping of initial media.  By pre-gathering candidates into the pool, it can exchange and start sending connectivity checks from these candidates almost immediately upon receipt of a call. Note though that by holding on to these pre-gathered candidates, which will be kept alive as long as they may be needed, the application will consume resources on the STUN/TURN servers it is using.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.1">Video size negotiation is the process through which a receiver can use the "a=imageattr" SDP attribute <a href="#RFC6236">[RFC6236]</a> to indicate what video frame sizes it is capable of receiving. A receiver may have hard limits on what its video decoder can process, or it may have some maximum set by policy.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.p.2">Note that certain codecs support transmission of samples with aspect ratios other than 1.0 (i.e., non-square pixels).  JSEP implementations will not transmit non-square pixels, but SHOULD receive and render such video with the correct aspect ratio.  However, sample aspect ratio has no impact on the size negotiation described below; all dimensions are measured in pixels, whether square or not.  </p>
<h3 id="rfc.section.3.6.1"><a href="#rfc.section.3.6.1">3.6.1.</a> Creating an imageattr Attribute</h3>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.1">The receiver will first intersect any known local limits (e.g., hardware decoder capababilities, local policy) to determine the absolute minimum and maximum sizes it can receive.  If there are no known local limits, the "a=imageattr" attribute SHOULD be omitted.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.2">Otherwise, an "a=imageattr" attribute is created with "recv" direction, and the resulting resolution space formed from the aforementioned intersection is used to specify its minimum and maximum x= and y= values. If the intersection is the null set, i.e., the degenerate case of no permitted resolutions, this MUST be represented by x=0 and y=0 values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.3">The rules here express a single set of preferences, and therefore, the "a=imageattr" q= value is not important. It SHOULD be set to 1.0.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.4">The "a=imageattr" field is payload type specific. When all video codecs supported have the same capabilities, use of a single attribute, with the wildcard payload type (*), is RECOMMENDED. However, when the supported video codecs have different limitations, specific "a=imageattr" attributes MUST be inserted for each payload type.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.1.p.5">As an example, consider a system with a multiformat video decoder, which is capable of decoding any resolution from 48x48 to 720p, In this case, the implementation would generate this attribute:</p>

<p><a href="#RFC6236">[RFC6236]</a> defines "a=imageattr" to be an advisory field. This means that it does not absolutely constrain the video formats that the sender can use, but gives an indication of the preferred values.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.2">This specification prescribes more specific behavior. When a sender of a given MediaStreamTrack, which is producing video of a certain resolution, receives an "a=imageattr recv" attribute, it MUST check to see if the original resolution meets the size criteria specified in the attribute, and adapt the resolution accordingly by scaling (if appropriate). Note that when considering a MediaStreamTrack that is producing rotated video, the unrotated resolution MUST be used. This is required regardless of whether the receiver supports performing receive-side rotation (e.g., through CVO <a href="#TS26.114">[TS26.114]</a>), as it significantly simplifies the matching logic.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.3">For the purposes of resolution negotiation, only size limits are considered. Any other values, e.g. picture or sample aspect ratio, MUST be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.4">When communicating with a non-JSEP endpoint, multiple relevant "a=imageattr recv" attributes may be present in a received m= section. If this occurs, attributes other than the one with the highest "q=" value MUST be ignored. If multiple attributes have the same "q=" value, those that appear after the first such attribute in the m= section MUST be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.5">If an "a=imageattr recv" attribute references a different video payload type than what has been selected for sending the MediaStreamTrack, it MUST be ignored.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.6">If the original resolution matches the size limits in the attribute, the track MUST be transmitted untouched.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.7">If the original resolution exceeds the size limits in the attribute, the sender SHOULD apply downscaling to the output of the MediaStreamTrack in order to satisfy the limits.  Downscaling MUST NOT change the track aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.8">If the original resolution is less than the size limits in the attribute, upscaling is needed, but this may not be appropriate in all cases. To address this concern, the application can set an upscaling policy for each sent track.  For this case, if upscaling is permitted by policy, the sender SHOULD apply upscaling in order to provide the desired resolution. Otherwise, the sender MUST NOT apply upscaling.  The sender SHOULD NOT upscale in other cases, even if the policy permits it. Upscaling MUST NOT change the track aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.9">If there is no appropriate and permitted scaling mechanism that allows the received size limits to be satisfied, the sender MUST NOT transmit the track.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.10">If the attribute includes a "sar=" (sample aspect ratio) value set to something other than "1.0", indicating the receiver wants to receive non-square pixels, this cannot be satisfied and the sender MUST NOT transmit the track.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.6.2.p.11">In the special case of receiving a maximum resolution of [0, 0], as described above, the sender MUST NOT transmit the track.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.1">JSEP supports simulcast transmission of a MediaStreamTrack, where multiple encodings of the source media can be transmitted within the context of a single m= section. The current JSEP API is designed to allow applications to send simulcasted media but only to receive a single encoding. This allows for multi-user scenarios where each sending client sends multiple encodings to a server, which then, for each receiving client, chooses the appropriate encoding to forward.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.2">Applications request support for simulcast by configuring multiple encodings on an RtpSender, which, upon generation of an offer or answer, are indicated in SDP markings on the corresponding m= section, as described below. Receivers that understand simulcast and are willing to receive it will also include SDP markings to indicate their support, and JSEP endpoints will use these markings to determine whether simulcast is permitted for a given RtpSender. If simulcast support is not negotiated, the RtpSender will only use the first configured encoding.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.3">Note that the exact simulcast parameters are up to the sending application. While the aforementioned SDP markings are provided to ensure the remote side can receive and demux multiple simulcast encodings, the specific resolutions and bitrates to be used for each encoding are purely a send-side decision in JSEP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.4">JSEP currently does not provide a mechanism to configure receipt of simulcast. This means that if simulcast is offered by the remote endpoint, the answer generated by a JSEP endpoint will not indicate support for receipt of simulcast, and as such the remote endpoint will only send a single encoding per m= section.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.5">In addition, JSEP does not provide a mechanism to handle an incoming offer requesting simulcast from the JSEP endpoint.  This means that established simulcast streams will continue to work through a received re-offer, but setting up initial simulcast by way of a received offer requires out-of-band signaling or SDP inspection. Future versions of this specification may add additional APIs to provide direct control.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.7.p.6">When using JSEP to transmit multiple encodings from a RtpSender, the techniques from <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast]</a> and <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid]</a> are used. Specifically, when multiple encodings have been configured for a RtpSender, the m= section for the RtpSender will include an "a=simulcast" attribute, as defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-simulcast]</a>, Section 6.2, with a "send" simulcast stream description that lists each desired encoding, and no "recv" simulcast stream description.  The m= section will also include an "a=rid" attribute for each encoding, as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-rid]</a>, Section 4; the use of RID identifiers allows the individual encodings to be disambiguated even though they are all part of the same m= section.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.p.1">Some call signaling systems allow various types of forking where an SDP Offer may be provided to more than one device. For example, SIP <a href="#RFC3261">[RFC3261]</a> defines both a "Parallel Search" and "Sequential Search". Although these are primarily signaling level issues that are outside the scope of JSEP, they do have some impact on the configuration of the media plane that is relevant. When forking happens at the signaling layer, the Javascript application responsible for the signaling needs to make the decisions about what media should be sent or received at any point of time, as well as which remote endpoint it should communicate with; JSEP is used to make sure the media engine can make the RTP and media perform as required by the application. The basic operations that the applications can have the media engine do are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, but keep all the resources reserved in the offer.</li>
  <li>Start exchanging media with a given remote peer, and free any resources in the offer that are not being used.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.1.p.1">Sequential forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, but only one active session ever exists at a time; no mixing of received media is performed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.1.p.2">JSEP handles sequential forking well, allowing the application to easily control the policy for selecting the desired remote endpoint. When an answer arrives from one of the callees, the application can choose to apply it either as a provisional answer, leaving open the possibility of using a different answer in the future, or apply it as a final answer, ending the setup flow.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.1.p.3">In a "first-one-wins" situation, the first answer will be applied as a final answer, and the application will reject any subsequent answers. In SIP parlance, this would be ACK + BYE.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.1.p.4">In a "last-one-wins" situation, all answers would be applied as provisional answers, and any previous call leg will be terminated. At some point, the application will end the setup process, perhaps with a timer; at this point, the application could reapply the pending remote description as a final answer.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.1">Parallel forking involves a call being dispatched to multiple remote callees, where each callee can accept the call, and multiple simultaneous active signaling sessions can be established as a result. If multiple callees send media at the same time, the possibilities for handling this are described in Section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>. Most SIP devices today only support exchanging media with a single device at a time, and do not try to mix multiple early media audio sources, as that could result in a confusing situation. For example, consider having a European ringback tone mixed together with the North American ringback tone - the resulting sound would not be like either tone, and would confuse the user. If the signaling application wishes to only exchange media with one of the remote endpoints at a time, then from a media engine point of view, this is exactly like the sequential forking case.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.2">In the parallel forking case where the Javascript application wishes to simultaneously exchange media with multiple peers, the flow is slightly more complex, but the Javascript application can follow the strategy that <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a> describes using UPDATE. The UPDATE approach allows the signaling to set up a separate media flow for each peer that it wishes to exchange media with. In JSEP, this offer used in the UPDATE would be formed by simply creating a new PeerConnection and making sure that the same local media streams have been added into this new PeerConnection. Then the new PeerConnection object would produce a SDP offer that could be used by the signaling to perform the UPDATE strategy discussed in <a href="#RFC3960">[RFC3960]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.8.2.p.3">As a result of sharing the media streams, the application will end up with N parallel PeerConnection sessions, each with a local and remote description and their own local and remote addresses. The media flow from these sessions can be managed using setDirection (see <a href="#sec.transceiver-set-direction">Section 4.2.3</a>), or the application can choose to play out the media from all sessions mixed together.

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.1">Session description objects (RTCSessionDescription) may be of type "offer", "pranswer", "answer" or "rollback". These types provide information as to how the description parameter should be parsed, and how the media state should be changed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.2">"offer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an offer; said description may include many possible media configurations. A description used as an "offer" may be applied anytime the PeerConnection is in a stable state, or as an update to a previously supplied but unanswered "offer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.3">"pranswer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an answer, but not a final answer, and so should not result in the freeing of allocated resources. It may result in the start of media transmission, if the answer does not specify an inactive media direction. A description used as a "pranswer" may be applied as a response to an "offer", or an update to a previously sent "pranswer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.4">"answer" indicates that a description should be parsed as an answer, the offer-answer exchange should be considered complete, and any resources (decoders, candidates) that are no longer needed can be released. A description used as an "answer" may be applied as a response to an "offer", or an update to a previously sent "pranswer".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.5">The only difference between a provisional and final answer is that the final answer results in the freeing of any unused resources that were allocated as a result of the offer. As such, the application can use some discretion on whether an answer should be applied as provisional or final, and can change the type of the session description as needed. For example, in a serial forking scenario, an application may receive multiple "final" answers, one from each remote endpoint. The application could choose to accept the initial answers as provisional answers, and only apply an answer as final when it receives one that meets its criteria (e.g. a live user instead of voicemail).</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.p.6">"rollback" is a special session description type implying that the state machine should be rolled back to the previous stable state, as described in <a href="#sec.rollback">Section 4.1.8.2</a>. The contents MUST be empty.</p>
<h4 id="rfc.section.4.1.8.1"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.8.1">4.1.8.1.</a> <a href="#sec.use-of-provisional-answer" id="sec.use-of-provisional-answer">Use of Provisional Answers</a></h4>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.1.p.1">Most applications will not need to create answers using the "pranswer" type. While it is good practice to send an immediate response to an offer, in order to warm up the session transport and prevent media clipping, the preferred handling for a JSEP application is to create and send a "sendonly" final answer with a null MediaStreamTrack immediately after receiving the offer, which will prevent media from being sent by the caller, and allow media to be sent immediately upon answer by the callee.  Later, when the callee actually accepts the call, the application can plug in the real MediaStreamTrack and create a new "sendrecv" offer to update the previous offer/answer pair and start bidirectional media flow. While this could also be done with a "sendonly" pranswer, followed by a "sendrecv" answer, the initial pranswer leaves the offer-answer exchange open, which means that the caller cannot send an updated offer during this time.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.1.p.2">As an example, consider a typical JSEP application that wants to set up audio and video as quickly as possible. When the callee receives an offer with audio and video MediaStreamTracks, it will send an immediate answer accepting these tracks as sendonly (meaning that the caller will not send the callee any media yet, and because the callee has not yet added its own MediaStreamTracks, the callee will not send any media either). It will then ask the user to accept the call and acquire the needed local tracks.  Upon acceptance by the user, the application will plug in the tracks it has acquired, which, because ICE and DTLS handshaking have likely completed by this point, can start transmitting immediately.  The application will also send a new offer to the remote side indicating call acceptance and moving the audio and video to be two-way media. A detailed example flow along these lines is shown in <a href="#sec.warmup-example">Section 7.3</a>. </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.1.p.3">Of course, some applications may not be able to perform this double offer-answer exchange, particularly ones that are attempting to gateway to legacy signaling protocols. In these cases, pranswer can still provide the application with a mechanism to warm up the transport.</p>
<h4 id="rfc.section.4.1.8.2"><a href="#rfc.section.4.1.8.2">4.1.8.2.</a> <a href="#sec.rollback" id="sec.rollback">Rollback</a></h4>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.2.p.1">In certain situations it may be desirable to "undo" a change made to setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription.  Consider a case where a call is ongoing, and one side wants to change some of the session parameters; that side generates an updated offer and then calls setLocalDescription. However, the remote side, either before or after setRemoteDescription, decides it does not want to accept the new parameters, and sends a reject message back to the offerer. Now, the offerer, and possibly the answerer as well, need to return to a stable state and the previous local/remote description. To support this, we introduce the concept of "rollback".</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.2.p.2">A rollback discards any proposed changes to the session, returning the state machine to the stable state, and setting the pending local and/or remote description (see <a href="#sec.pendinglocaldescription">Section 4.1.12</a> and <a href="#sec.pendingremotedescription">Section 4.1.14</a>) to null. Any resources or candidates that were allocated by the abandoned local description are discarded; any media that is received will be processed according to the previous local and remote descriptions. Rollback can only be used to cancel proposed changes; there is no support for rolling back from a stable state to a previous stable state. Note that this implies that once the answerer has performed setLocalDescription with his answer, this cannot be rolled back.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.2.p.3">A rollback will disassociate any RtpTransceivers that were associated with m= sections by the application of the rolled-back session description (see <a href="#sec.applying-a-remote-desc">Section 5.9</a> and <a href="#sec.applying-a-local-desc">Section 5.8</a>). This means that some RtpTransceivers that were previously associated will no longer be associated with any m= section; in such cases, the value of the RtpTransceiver's mid property MUST be set to null, and the mapping between the transceiver and its m= section index MUST be discarded.  RtpTransceivers that were created by applying a remote offer that was subsequently rolled back MUST be stopped and removed from the PeerConnection.  However, a RtpTransceiver MUST NOT be removed if a track was attached to the RtpTransceiver via the addTrack method. This is so that an application may call addTrack, then call setRemoteDescription with an offer, then roll back that offer, then call createOffer and have a m= section for the added track appear in the generated offer.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.8.2.p.4">A rollback is performed by supplying a session description of type "rollback" with empty contents to either setLocalDescription or setRemoteDescription, depending on which was most recently used (i.e. if the new offer was supplied to setLocalDescription, the rollback should be done using setLocalDescription as well).</p>

<p id="rfc.section.4.1.9.p.1">The setLocalDescription method instructs the PeerConnection to apply the supplied session description as its local configuration. The type field indicates whether the description should be processed as an offer, provisional answer, or final answer; offers and answers are checked differently, using the various rules that exist for each SDP line.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.9.p.2">This API changes the local media state; among other things, it sets up local resources for receiving and decoding media. In order to successfully handle scenarios where the application wants to offer to change from one media format to a different, incompatible format, the PeerConnection must be able to simultaneously support use of both the current and pending local descriptions (e.g., support the codecs that exist in either description). This dual processing begins when the PeerConnection enters the have-local-offer state, and continues until setRemoteDescription is called with either a final answer, at which point the PeerConnection can fully adopt the pending local description, or a rollback, which results in a revert to the current local description.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.9.p.3">This API indirectly controls the candidate gathering process. When a local description is supplied, and the number of transports currently in use does not match the number of transports needed by the local description, the PeerConnection will create transports as needed and begin gathering candidates for each transport, using ones from the candidate pool if available.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.9.p.4">If setRemoteDescription was previously called with an offer, and setLocalDescription is called with an answer (provisional or final), and the media directions are compatible, and media is available to send, this will result in the starting of media transmission.</p>

<ul>
  <li>ICE, as specified in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, MUST be used. Note that the remote endpoint may use a Lite implementation; implementations MUST properly handle remote endpoints which do ICE-Lite.</li>

For data m= sections, implementations MUST support the "UDP/DTLS/SCTP" profile and MUST indicate this profile for each data m= line they produce in an offer.  Because ICE can select either UDP <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a> or TCP <a href="#RFC6544">[RFC6544]</a> transport depending on network conditions, this advertisement is consistent with ICE eventually selecting either either UDP or TCP.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.1.2.p.2">Unfortunately, in an attempt at compatibility, some endpoints generate other profile strings even when they mean to support one of these profiles. For instance, an endpoint might generate "RTP/AVP" but supply "a=fingerprint" and "a=rtcp-fb" attributes, indicating its willingness to support "(UDP,TCP)/TLS/RTP/SAVPF". In order to simplify compatibility with such endpoints, JSEP implementations MUST follow the following rules when processing the media m= sections in an offer:</p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>The profile in any "m=" line in any answer MUST exactly match the profile provided in the offer.</li>
  <li>Any profile matching the following patterns MUST be accepted: "RTP/[S]AVP[F]" and "(UDP/TCP)/TLS/RTP/SAVP[F]"</li>
  <li>Because DTLS-SRTP is REQUIRED, the choice of SAVP or AVP has no effect; support for DTLS-SRTP is determined by the presence of one or more "a=fingerprint" attribute.  Note that lack of an "a=fingerprint" attribute will lead to negotiation failure.</li>
  <li>The use of AVPF or AVP simply controls the timing rules used for RTCP feedback. If AVPF is provided, or an "a=rtcp-fb" attribute is present, assume AVPF timing, i.e., a default value of "trr-int=0". Otherwise, assume that AVPF is being used in an AVP compatible mode and use a value of "trr-int=4000".</li>
  <li>For data m= sections, implementations MUST support receiving the "UDP/DTLS/SCTP", "TCP/DTLS/SCTP", or "DTLS/SCTP" (for backwards compatibility) profiles.</li>

<ul>
  <li>The first SDP line MUST be "v=0", as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.1</li>
  <li>The second SDP line MUST be an "o=" line, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.2.

It is RECOMMENDED that the &lt;sess-id&gt; be generated as a 64-bit quantity with the high bit being sent to zero and the remaining 63 bits being cryptographically random. The value of the &lt;nettype&gt; &lt;addrtype&gt; &lt;unicast-address&gt; tuple SHOULD be set to a non-meaningful address, such as IN IP4 0.0.0.0, to prevent leaking the local address in this field. As mentioned in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, the entire o= line needs to be unique, but selecting a random number for &lt;sess-id&gt; is sufficient to accomplish this.</li>
  <li>The third SDP line MUST be a "s=" line, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.3; to match the "o=" line, a single dash SHOULD be used as the session name, e.g. "s=-". Note that this differs from the advice in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a> which proposes a single space, but as both "o=" and "s=" are meaningless, having the same meaningless value seems clearer.</li>
  <li>Session Information ("i="), URI ("u="), Email Address ("e="), Phone Number ("p="), Repeat Times ("r="), and Time Zones ("z=") lines are not useful in this context and SHOULD NOT be included.</li>
  <li>Encryption Keys ("k=") lines do not provide sufficient security and MUST NOT be included.</li>
  <li>A "t=" line MUST be added, as specified in <a href="#RFC4566">[RFC4566]</a>, Section 5.9; both &lt;start-time&gt; and &lt;stop-time&gt; SHOULD be set to zero, e.g. "t=0 0".</li>

  <li>The media formats in the answer MAY include codecs present in the offer that were discarded in a previous offer/answer exchange. This is necessary for compatibility with third- party call control and SIP use cases.</li>
  <li>Unless excluded by the above restrictions, the media formats MUST include the mandatory audio/video codecs as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-audio">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-audio]</a>(see Section 3) and <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-video">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-video]</a>(see Section 5).</li>

There are no known scenarios in which this causes problems, but if this is a concern, the solution is simply to use createOffer to ensure a unique &lt;session-version&gt;.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.4">If the initial offer was applied using setLocalDescription, but an answer from the remote side has not yet been applied, meaning the PeerConnection is still in the "local-offer" state, an offer is generated by following the steps in the "stable" state above, along with these exceptions: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The "s=" and "t=" lines MUST stay the same.</li>
  <li>If any RtpTransceiver has been added, and there exists an m= section with a zero port in the current local description or the current remote description, that m= section MUST be recycled by generating an m= section for the added RtpTransceiver as if the m= section were being added to the session description, placed at the same index as the m= section with a zero port.</li>
  <li>If an RtpTransceiver is stopped and is not associated with an m= section, an m= section MUST NOT be generated for it. This prevents adding back RtpTransceivers whose m= sections were recycled and used for a new RtpTransceiver in a previous offer/ answer exchange, as described above.</li>
  <li>If an RtpTransceiver has been stopped and is associated with an m= section, and the m= section is not being recycled as described above, an m= section MUST be generated for it with the port set to zero and all "a=msid" lines removed.</li>
  <li>For RtpTransceivers that are not stopped, the "a=msid" line(s) MUST stay the same if they are present in the current description, regardless of changes to the transceiver's direction or track. If no "a=msid" line is present in the current description, "a=msid" line(s) MUST be generated according to the same rules as for an initial offer.</li>
  <li>Each "m=" and c=" line MUST be filled in with the port, protocol, and address of the default candidate for the m= section, as described in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, Section 4.3. If ICE checking has already completed for one or more candidate pairs and a candidate pair is in active use, then that pair MUST be used, even if ICE has not yet completed. Note that this differs from the guidance in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, Section 9.1.2.2, which only refers to offers created when ICE has completed. In each case, if no RTP candidates have yet been gathered, dummy values MUST be used, as described above.</li>
  <li>Each "a=mid" line MUST stay the same.</li>
  <li>Each "a=ice-ufrag" and "a=ice-pwd" line MUST stay the same, unless the ICE configuration has changed (either changes to the supported STUN/TURN servers, or the ICE candidate policy), or the "IceRestart" option ( <a href="#sec.icerestart">Section 5.2.3.1</a> was specified. If the m= section is bundled into another m= section, it still MUST NOT contain any ICE credentials.</li>
  <li>If the m= section is not bundled into another m= section, its "a=rtcp" attribute line MUST be filled in with the port and address of the default RTCP candidate, as indicated in <a href="#RFC5761">[RFC5761]</a>, Section 5.1.3. If no RTCP candidates have yet been gathered, dummy values MUST be used, as described in the initial offer section above.</li>
  <li>If the m= section is not bundled into another m= section, for each candidate that has been gathered during the most recent gathering phase (see <a href="#sec.ice-gather-overview">Section 3.5.1</a>), an "a=candidate" line MUST be added, as defined in <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>, Section 4.3., paragraph 3.  If candidate gathering for the section has completed, an "a=end-of-candidates" attribute MUST be added, as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ice-trickle">[I-D.ietf-ice-trickle]</a>, Section 9.3.  If the m= section is bundled into another m= section, both "a=candidate" and "a=end-of-candidates" MUST be omitted.</li>
  <li>For RtpTransceivers that are still present, the "a=rid" lines MUST stay the same.</li>
  <li>For RtpTransceivers that are still present, any "a=simulcast" line MUST stay the same.</li>
  <li>If any RtpTransceiver has been stopped, the port MUST be set to zero and all "a=msid" lines MUST be removed.</li>
  <li>If any RtpTransceiver has been added, and there exists a m= section with a zero port in the current local description or the current remote description, that m= section MUST be recycled by generating a m= section for the added RtpTransceiver as if the m= section were being added to session description, except that instead of adding it, the generated m= section replaces the m= section with a zero port. The new m= section MUST contain a new MID.</li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.5">If the initial offer was applied using setLocalDescription, and an answer from the remote side has been applied using setRemoteDescription, meaning the PeerConnection is in the "remote-pranswer" or "stable" states, an offer is generated based on the negotiated session descriptions by following the steps mentioned for the "local-offer" state above.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.6">In addition, for each non-recycled, non-rejected m= section in the new offer, the following adjustments are made based on the contents of the corresponding m= section in the current remote description, if any: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The m= line and corresponding "a=rtpmap" and "a=fmtp" lines MUST only include codecs present in the most recent answer which have not been excluded by the codec preferences of the associated transceiver. Note that non-JSEP endpoints are not subject to these restrictions, and might offer media formats that were not present in the most recent answer, as specified in <a href="#RFC3264">[RFC3264]</a>, Section 8.  Therefore, JSEP implementations MUST be prepared to receive such offers.</li>
  <li>Unless codec preferences have been set for the associated transceiver, the media formats on the m= line MUST be generated in the same order as in the current local description.</li>
  <li>The RTP header extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer.</li>
  <li>The RTCP feedback extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer.</li>
  <li>The "a=rtcp" line MUST only be added if the most recent answer did not include an "a=rtcp-mux" line.</li>
  <li>The "a=rtcp-mux" line MUST only be added if present in the most recent answer.</li>
  <li>The "a=rtcp-mux-only" line MUST NOT be added.</li>
  <li>The "a=rtcp-rsize" line MUST only be added if present in the most recent answer.</li>
  <li>An "a=bundle-only" line MUST NOT be added, as indicated in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>, Section 6.

  <li>Note that if media m= sections are bundled into a data m= section, then certain TRANSPORT and IDENTICAL attributes may appear in the data m= section even if they would otherwise only be appropriate for a media m= section (e.g., "a=rtcp-mux").  This cannot happen in initial offers because in the initial offer JSEP implementations always list media m= sections (if any) before the data m= section (if any), and at least one of those media m= sections will not have the "a=bundle-only" attribute.  Therefore, in initial offers, any "a=bundle-only" m= sections will be bundled into a preceding non-bundle-only media m= section.  </li>
</ul>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.7">The "a=group:BUNDLE" attribute MUST include the MID identifiers specified in the bundle group in the most recent answer, minus any m= sections that have been marked as rejected, plus any newly added or re-enabled m= sections. In other words, the bundle attribute must contain all m= sections that were previously bundled, as long as they are still alive, as well as any new m= sections.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.2.p.8">"a=group:LS" attributes are generated in the same way as for initial offers, with the additional stipulation that any lip sync groups that were present in the most recent answer MUST continue to exist and MUST contain any previously existing MID identifiers, as long as the identified m= sections still exist and are not rejected, and the group still contains at least two MID identifiers.  This ensures that any synchronized "recvonly" m= sections continue to be synchronized in the new offer.  </p>

If this option is specified on an initial offer, it has no effect (since a new ICE ufrag and pwd are already generated).

For codecs that have their own internal silence suppression support, the appropriate fmtp parameters for that codec MUST be specified to indicate that silence suppression for received audio is desired.  For example, when using the Opus codec <a href="#RFC6716">[RFC6716]</a>, the "usedtx=1" parameter, specified in <a href="#RFC7587">[RFC7587]</a>, would be used in the offer. This option allows the endpoint to significantly reduce the amount of audio bandwidth it receives, at the cost of some fidelity, depending on the quality of the remote VAD algorithm.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.2.3.2.p.2">If the "VoiceActivityDetection" option is specified, with a value of "false", the JSEP implementation MUST NOT emit "CN" codecs.

<ul>
  <li>If the m= section has been rejected (i.e. port is set to zero in the answer), stop any reception or transmission of media for this section, and, unless a non-rejected m= section is bundled with this m= section, discard any associated ICE components, as described in Section 9.2.1.3 of <a href="#RFC5245">[RFC5245]</a>.</li>

Specifically, begin or continue sending the requested feedback types and reacting to received feedback, as specified in <a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a>, Section 4.2.

<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">This section shows a more involved example of a session between two JSEP endpoints. Trickle ICE is used in full trickle mode, with a bundle policy of "max-bundle", an RTCP mux policy of "require", and a single TURN server. Initially, both Alice and Bob establish an audio channel and a data channel. Later, Bob adds two video flows, one for his video feed, and one for screensharing, both supporting FEC, and with the video feed configured for simulcast. Alice accepts these video flows, but does not add video flows of her own, so they are handled as recvonly. Alice also specifies a maximum video decoder resolution.  </p>

<h2 id="rfc.section.7.3"><a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> <a href="#sec.warmup-example" id="sec.warmup-example">Early Transport Warmup Example</a></h2>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">This example demonstrates the early warmup technique described in <a href="#sec.use-of-provisional-answer">Section 4.1.8.1</a>. Here, Alice's endpoint sends an offer to Bob's endpoint to start an audio/video call. Bob immediately responds with an answer that accepts the audio/video m= sections, but marks them as sendonly (from his perspective), meaning that Alice will not yet send media. This allows the JSEP implementation to start negotiating ICE and DTLS immediately. Bob's endpoint then prompts him to answer the call, and when he does, his endpoint sends a second offer which enables the audio and video m= sections, and thereby bidirectional media transmission. The advantage of such a flow is that as soon as the first answer is received, the implementation can proceed with ICE and DTLS negotiation and establish the session transport. If the transport setup completes before the second offer is sent, then media can be transmitted immediately by the callee immediately upon answering the call, minimizing perceived post-dial-delay.  The second offer/answer exchange can also change the preferred codecs or other session parameters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">This example also makes use of the "relay" ICE candidate policy described in <a href="#sec.ice-candidate-policy">Section 3.5.3</a> to minimize the ICE gathering and checking needed.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.p.1">The IETF has published separate documents <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch]</a> <a href="#I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security">[I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security]</a> describing the security architecture for WebRTC as a whole. The remainder of this section describes security considerations for this document.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.2">While formally the JSEP interface is an API, it is better to think of it is an Internet protocol, with the JS being untrustworthy from the perspective of the endpoint. Thus, the threat model of <a href="#RFC3552">[RFC3552]</a> applies. In particular, JS can call the API in any order and with any inputs, including malicious ones.  This is particularly relevant when we consider the SDP which is passed to setLocalDescription(). While correct API usage requires that the application pass in SDP which was derived from createOffer() or createAnswer(), there is no guarantee that applications do so. The JSEP implementation MUST be prepared for the JS to pass in bogus data instead.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.3">Conversely, the application programmer MUST recognize that the JS does not have complete control of endpoint behavior. One case that bears particular mention is that editing ICE candidates out of the SDP or suppressing trickled candidates does not have the expected behavior: implementations will still perform checks from those candidates even if they are not sent to the other side.  Thus, for instance, it is not possible to prevent the remote peer from learning your public IP address by removing server reflexive candidates. Applications which wish to conceal their public IP address should instead configure the ICE agent to use only relay candidates.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">The following text is meant to completely replace section "Associating RTP/RTCP Streams With Correct SDP Media Description" of <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">As described in <a href="#RFC3550">[RFC3550]</a>, RTP packets are associated with RTP streams <a href="#RFC7656">[RFC7656]</a>. Each RTP stream is identified by an SSRC value, and each RTP packet includes an SSRC field that is used to associate the packet with the correct RTP stream.  RTCP packets also use SSRCs to identify which RTP streams the packet relates to. However, a RTCP packet can contain multiple SSRC fields, in the course of providing feedback or reports on different RTP streams, and therefore can be associated with multiple such streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">In order to be able to process received RTP/RTCP packets correctly, it must be possible to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line, as the "m=" line and SDP attributes associated with the "m=" line contain information needed to process the packets.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.4">As all RTP streams associated with a BUNDLE group use the same address:port combination for sending and receiving RTP/RTCP packets, the local address:port combination cannot be used to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line. In addition, multiple RTP streams might be associated with the same "m=" line.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.5">An offerer and answerer can inform each other which SSRC values they will use for an RTP stream by using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute <a href="#RFC5576">[RFC5576]</a>.  However, an offerer will not know which SSRC values the answerer will use until the offerer has received the answer providing that information. Due to this, before the offerer has received the answer, the offerer will not be able to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line using the SSRC value associated with the RTP stream. In addition, the offerer and answerer may start using new SSRC values mid-session, without informing each other using the SDP 'ssrc' attribute.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.6">In order for an offerer and answerer to always be able to associate an RTP stream with the correct "m=" line, the offerer and answerer using the BUNDLE extension MUST support the mechanism defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>, Section 14, where the offerer and answerer insert the identification-tag associated with an "m=" line (provided by the remote peer) into RTP and RTCP packets associated with a BUNDLE group.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.7">When using this mechanism, the mapping from an SSRC to an identification-tag is carried in RTP header extensions or RTCP SDES packets, as specified in <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a>, Section 14). Since a compound RTCP packet can contain multiple RTCP SDES packets, and each RTCP SDES packet can contain multiple chunks, a single RTCP packet can contain several SSRC to identification-tag mappings. The offerer and answerer maintain tables used for routing that are updated each time an RTP/RTCP packet contains new information that affects how packets should be routed.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.8">However, some implementations of <a href="#I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation">[I-D.ietf-mmusic-sdp-bundle-negotiation]</a> may not include this identification-tag in their RTP and RTCP traffic when using BUNDLE, and instead use a payload type based mechanism for demuxing.  In this situation, each "m=" line MUST use unique payload type values, in order for the payload type to be a reliable indicator of the relevant "m=" line for the RTP stream.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.9">Applications can implement RTP stacks in many different ways. The algorithm below details one way that demultiplexing can be accomplished, but is not meant to be prescriptive about exactly how an RTP stack needs to be implemented.  Applications MAY use any algorithm that achieves equivalent results to those described in the algorithm below.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.10">To prepare for demultiplexing RTP/RTCP packets to the correct "m=" line, the following steps MUST be followed for each BUNDLE group.</p>
<p/>

<ul class="empty">
  <li>Construct a table mapping MID to "m=" line for each "m=" line in this BUNDLE group. Note that an "m=" line may only have one MID.</li>
  <li>Construct a table mapping incoming SSRC to "m=" line for each "m=" line in this BUNDLE group and for each SSRC configured for receiving in that "m=" line.</li>
  <li>Construct a table mapping outgoing SSRC to "m=line" for each "m=" line in this BUNDLE group and for each SSRC configured for sending in that "m=" line.</li>
  <li>Construct a table mapping payload type to "m=" line for each "m=" line in the BUNDLE group and for each payload type configured for receiving in that "m=" line. If any payload type is configured for receiving in more than one "m=" line in the BUNDLE group, do not it include it in the table, as it cannot be used to uniquely identify a "m=" line.</li>
  <li>Note that for each of these tables, there can only be one mapping for any given key (MID, SSRC, or PT). In other words, the tables are not multimaps.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.12">As "m=" lines are added or removed from the BUNDLE groups, or their configurations are changed, the tables above MUST also be updated.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.13">For each RTP packet received, the following steps MUST be followed to route the packet to the correct "m=" section within a BUNDLE group. Note that the phrase 'deliver a packet to the "m=" line' means to further process the packet as would normally happen with RTP/RTCP, if it were received on a transport associated with that "m=" line outside of a BUNDLE group (i.e., if the "m=" line were not BUNDLEd), including dropping an RTP packet if the packet's PT does not match any PT in the "m=" line.</p>
<p/>

<ul class="empty">
  <li>If the packet has a MID, and that MID is not in the table mapping MID to "m=" line, drop the packet and stop.</li>
  <li>If the packet has a MID, and the packet's extended sequence number is greater than that of the last MID update, as discussed in <a href="#RFC7941">[RFC7941]</a>, Section 4.2.6, update the incoming SSRC mapping table to include an entry that maps the packet's SSRC to the "m=" line for that MID.</li>
  <li>If the packet's SSRC is in the incoming SSRC mapping table, check that the packet's PT matches a PT included on the associated "m=" line. If so, route the packet to that associated "m=" line and stop; otherwise drop the packet and stop.</li>
  <li>If the packet's payload type is in the payload type table, update the the incoming SSRC mapping table to include an entry that maps the packet's SSRC to the "m=" line for that payload type. In addition, route the packet to the associated "m=" line and stop.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, drop the packet.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.15">For each RTCP packet received (including each RTCP packet that is part of a compound RTCP packet), the packet MUST be routed to the "m=" line for the RTP streams it contains information about. This routing is type-dependent, as each kind of RTCP packet has its own mechanism for associating it with the relevant RTP streams.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.16">Packets for which no appropriate "m=" line can be identified (i.e., for unknown RTP streams) are not relevant in the context of this algorithm and MAY be dropped. This situation may occur with certain multiparty RTP topologies.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.17">Rules for handling the various types of RTCP packets are explained below.</p>
<p/>

<ul class="empty">
  <li>If the packet is of type SDES, for each chunk in the packet whose SSRC is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC.  In addition, for any SDES MID items contained in these chunks, if the MID is found in the table mapping MID to "m=" line, update the incoming SSRC table to include an entry that maps the chunk's SSRC to the "m=" line associated with that MID, unless the packet is older than the packet that most recently updated the mapping for this SSRC, as discussed in <a href="#RFC7941">[RFC7941]</a>, Section 4.2.6.</li>
  <li>Note that if an SDES packet is received as part of a compound RTCP packet, the SSRC to "m=" line mapping may not exist until the SDES packet is handled (e.g., in the case where RTCP for a source is received before any RTP packets). Therefore, when processing a compound packet, any contained SDES packet MUST be handled first.</li>
  <li>If the packet is of type BYE, it indicates that the RTP streams referenced in the packet are ending. Therefore, for each SSRC indicated in the packet that is found in the incoming SSRC table, first deliver a copy of the packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC, but then remove the entry for that SSRC from the incoming SSRC table.</li>
  <li>If the packet is of type SR or RR, for each report block in the report whose "SSRC of source" is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the RTCP packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC. In addition, if the packet is of type SR, and the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC.</li>
  <li>If the implementation supports RTCP XR and the packet is of type XR, as defined in <a href="#RFC3611">[RFC3611]</a>, for each report block in the report whose "SSRC of source" is is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the RTCP packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC.  In addition, if the sender SSRC for the packet is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC.</li>
  <li>If the packet is a feedback message of type RTPFB or PSFB, as defined in <a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a>, it will contain a media source SSRC, and this SSRC is used for routing certain subtypes of feedback messages. However, several subtypes of PSFB messages include target SSRC(s) in a section called Feedback Control Information (FCI). For these messages, the target SSRC(s) are used for routing.</li>
  <li>If the packet is a feedback message that does not include target SSRCs in its FCI section, and the media source SSRC is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver the packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC.  RTPFB and PSFB types that are handled in this way include: <dl><dt>Generic NACK:</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a> (PT=RTPFB, FMT=1).  </dd><dt>Picture Loss Indication (PLI):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=1).  </dd><dt>Slice Loss Indication (SLI):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=2).  </dd><dt>Reference Picture Selection Indication (RPSI):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC4585">[RFC4585]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=3).  </dd></dl><p> </p></li>
  <li>If the packet is a feedback message that does include target SSRC(s) in its FCI section, it can either be a request or a notification. Requests reference a RTP stream that is being sent by the message recipient, whereas notifications are responses to an earlier request, and therefore reference a RTP stream that is being received by the message recipient.</li>
  <li>If the packet is a feedback request that includes target SSRC(s), for each target SSRC that is found in the outgoing SSRC table, deliver a copy of the RTCP packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC. PSFB types that are handled in this way include: <dl><dt>Full Intra Request (FIR):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=4).  </dd><dt>Temporal-Spatial Trade-off Request (TSTR):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=5).  </dd><dt>H.271 Video Back Channel Message               (VBCM):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=7).  </dd><dt>Layer Refresh Request (LRR):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#I-D.ietf-avtext-lrr">[I-D.ietf-avtext-lrr]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=TBD).  </dd></dl><p> </p></li>
  <li>If the packet is a feedback notification that include target SSRC(s), for each target SSRC that is found in the incoming SSRC table, deliver a copy of the RTCP packet to the "m=" line associated with that SSRC. PSFB types that are handled in this way include: <dl><dt>Temporal-Spatial Trade-off Notification               (TSTN):</dt><dd style="margin-left: 8"><a href="#RFC5104">[RFC5104]</a> (PT=PSFB, FMT=6). This message is a notification in response to a prior TSTR.  </dd></dl><p> </p></li>
  <li>If the packet is of type APP, the only routing information included is the source of the packet, and therefore the packet could be related to any existing "m=" line. Accordingly, deliver a copy of the packet to each "m=" line.</li>
